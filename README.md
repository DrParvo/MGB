# MGB
The Marvelous GrowBrain


The Marvelous Growbrain will attempt to commit a great heresy.  We see a problem with the world today in the dastardly dualistic dichotomy between Producer and Consumer.  We will blur this distinction until it fades away.  The MGB empowers people to produce food for themselves and their chosen group.  The group or individual can work directly in the production of their own food, removing the transaction from the marketplace as it stands today.  Your job is now not to earn money for food, your job creates the food directly.

The MGB makes expert farmers out of novices.  Ad-hoc food organizations can spontaneously appear as needed.  The unit monitors and controls all growing conditions, and the user accesses this through a customizable Profile Page.  Expert knowledge of each crop type is provided.  MGB units connect to each other to form virtual co-ops, all coordinated between users and remotely accessible.  Inventory is tracked, web cams allow monitoring.  All voltage-controllable devices are automated.  The garden will run itself, you become an administrator.  The MGB can also function as an air-gapped unit disconnected from the internet, for those remote or clandestine operations...

The MGB works as a benevolent anarchist.  It seeks to provide the real basis needed for alternative economies to start seriously challenging the Global Capitalist Economy, which is destroying the planet and preventing human evolution.  The MGB reduces Demand in the economy, which we believe will lower input prices, among other things.  We are grateful for what Capitalism has done for us, and now we embrace what is next.  We dont have to fight anyone or win any more elections, now we simply walk away from the agora, bringing with us the new recruits long disillusioned.  If they cant play fair, they can play with themselves.

Retired persons and poor communities now have meaningful jobs.  Apartment buildings with community gardens start producing serious yields.  Disaster relief efforts succeed effortlessly.  The MGB collects and saves data for the group to be able to track results and make improvements.

Please help, steal, modify, and share this project, so that it may be completed soon.  The software must remain free and open source.  The powerpoint presentation explains in more detail.  

The only free person is one who can live on their own terms, and reject any false values or lifestyle thrust upon it by those powers who would let them starve otherwise.  We can exist in peace, so that we may then turn our attention to solving the greater mysteries of life - the individual's Great Work.

Autonomous Abundance is Our Birthright.

Love is the law, love under will.  Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.


I love you,
Dr. Parvo
